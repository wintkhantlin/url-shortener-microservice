# 📊 Analytics Service

This is the data cruncher. The **Analytics Service** sits quietly in the background, listening for events and turning raw data into actionable insights.

## ⚙️ What does it do?

1.  **Listens:** It acts as a **Kafka Consumer**, picking up "Click Events" generated by the Redirect Service.
2.  **Processes:** It validates and enriches the data (though most heavy lifting is done at query time).
3.  **Stores:** It dumps massive amounts of data into **ClickHouse**, a columnar database designed for exactly this kind of analytics.
4.  **Serves:** It provides an API endpoint that queries ClickHouse to give you stats like "How many people from France clicked this link on an iPhone?"

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
